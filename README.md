# Freedom Stack v2 (WIP)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I will be removing Convex in favor of Bknd.io soon.

I've learned a lot since the first iteration of Freedom Stack.

I've used it in many projects, including as a home screen launcher on an Android phone.

Here's what I'm thinking...

Rules:

- Must be affordable tech
- Must feel elementary/vanilla to use and be easy to learn
- Must be entirely self-hostable (if needed)

- [x] Astro
- [x] AlpineJS + Alpine AJAX
- [x] TailwindCSS + Basecoat UI ~~(Or, Franken UI)~~
- [~] [Bknd](https://bknd.io)
- [x] Netlify [(But you can use other ways of deployment)](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/)

## Setup

Using Node Version Manager?

```bash
nvm use
```

Install the packages.

```bash
npm install
```

Now, let's run the app!

```bash
npm run dev
```
