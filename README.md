# Freedom Stack v2 (WIP)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is still a work in progress. It's improving continuously and will be ready soon.
> Documentation for using this project is currently limited but will be expanded shortly.

## Criteria for Freedom Stack v2

1. Must feel elementary/vanilla to use and be easy to learn
2. Must be financially accessible to all, meaning it should at least be able to be hosted for free at base tier without having to add a credit card
3. Must be entirely self-hostable (if needed)
4. Must use well-maintained, actively developed packages to ensure long-term sustainability
5. Must be able to work well with AI code editor assistants

## Stack

- [Astro](https://astro.build)
- [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev) + [Alpine AJAX](https://alpine-ajax.js.org/)
- [TailwindCSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/) + [Basecoat UI](https://basecoatui.com/)
- [Bknd](https://bknd.io)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), or host anywhere

## Basecoat UI

_"All of the shadcn/ui magic, none of the React. A components library built with Tailwind CSS that works with any web stack. [basecoatui.com](https://basecoatui.com/)"_

[Basecoat is easy to theme.](https://basecoatui.com/installation/#install-theming)

In the Cursor chat window you can type `@basecoat-ui.mdc` and get AI assistance for your Basecoat UI CSS.

## Bknd

> _"Experience the power of a lightweight, feature-rich backend that seamlessly integrates into your framework of choice."_

Imagine having your own Supabase-like backend, but you could host it anywhere you'd like? That's Bknd.

Since Bknd integrates into your framework of choice, it ships with Freedom Stack out of the box!

Here's the best explanation for the heart of [Bknd](https://docs.bknd.io/motivation) and why it's perfect for Freedom Stack.

### Remaining Bknd things

1. **issue (blocking)**: Given I am signed in as an admin, `/data/entity/users` page throws a 404 for some reason when trying to view list of users.

### Database

Develop on a local libSQL database, included by default without needing to configure anything.

When ready for production, I recommend using a database from [Turso](https://tur.so/freedomstack).

## Install

Run the following command to install this stack on your machine, without the commit history of this repo.

```bash
npx degit https://github.com/cameronapak/freedom-stack-v2 my-project
```

## Setup

### Create User

```bash
npx tsx node_modules/.bin/bknd user create
```

### Run App

Using Node Version Manager?

```bash
nvm use
```

Install the packages.

```bash
npm install
```

Now, let's run the app!

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Main changes since v1

1. We've replaced Astro DB with Bknd
2. Better Auth has been replaced with Bknd's built-in auth
3. Instead of using daisyUI, we now use Basecoat (think `shadcn-ui` but without React)
4. Instead of HTMX, we use Alpine Ajax (if you don't know what either one of these are... it's okay)

## Amazing Alternatives
