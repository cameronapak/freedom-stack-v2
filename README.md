# Freedom Stack v2 (WIP)

I've learned a lot since the first iteration of Freedom Stack.

I've used it in many projects, including as a home screen launcher on an Android phone. 

Here's what I'm thinking...

- [x] Astro
- [x] AlpineJS + Alpine AJAX
- [x] TailwindCSS + Basecoat UI ~~(Or, Franken UI)~~
- [ ] Convex + Convex Auth (Or, Better Auth)

Rules:
- Must be affordable tech
- Must feel elementary/vanilla to use and be easy to learn
- Must be entirely self-hostable (if needed)
